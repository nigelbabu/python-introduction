There's a lot of material on the internet and I'm trying to put them in one
place for other new python programmers.

* [Codeacademy][ca]
* [MIT Course][mit]
* [Dive into Python][dive]
* [Learn Python the Hard Way][hardpy]
* [Python.org's Beginner's Guide][beg-guide]

If you this more material needs to be in here, file an issue.

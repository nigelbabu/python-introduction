There's a lot of material on the internet and I'm trying to put them in one
place for other new Python programmers. Especally, when I'm training folks on
Python

#### [Codeacademy][ca]
You should be able to run through this course in 2 days. It's straight to the point and gets the basics right very well.


#### [MIT Course][mit]
This one is from 2008 and I used it myself when I started learning Python. It's a course for people who are not programmers to learn programming with python. If you'd like to watch someone explain to you, this is the best place to go.  Prof. Eric Grimson and Prof. John Guttag are great at explaining this very well.

#### [Dive into Python][dive]
Mark Pilgrim's very well-known book. You can buy the book, read it online, or download a PDF.

#### [Learn Python the Hard Way][hardpy]
Another book, written by Zed Shaw. Very good material. If you buy the book, you also get access to videos. The book is, however, free to read online.

#### [Python.org's Beginner's Guide][beg-guide]
If none of these materials above makes sense to you, the python.org website had a Beginner's Guide with links to a lot of resources.

If you think more material needs to be in here, file an issue.
